   A hexapod spider robot controlled by [Robotis CM-700 controller](http://support.robotis.com/en/product/auxdevice/controller/cm700_manual.htm), motorized by twenty [Robotis Dynamixel AX-18A servos](http://support.robotis.com/en/product/dynamixel/ax_series/ax-18f.htm), and one [Robotis AX-S1 integrated sensor](http://support.robotis.com/en/product/auxdevice/sensor/dxl_ax_s1.htm) mounted on its head. The robot frame is a slightly modified TrossenRobotics ABS PhantomX kit.
 

# Robot Controller (Robotis CM-700):

There are many options of robotic controllers in the market and it is a great fun to try it all. Initially I started this spider project using the 1st version of TrossenRobotics Arbotix controller with the open source software from the same company. Then I tried the ROBOTIS OpenCM9.04 open source controller along with its Arduino like IDE. Finally, I picked ROBOTIS CM-700 controller along with ROBOTIS RoboPlus Software. I’m not sure how long I will keep using it.

What I like about CM-700 is its compact design, the low-power 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller (ATMEL ATMEGA2561) which is widely used in many applications including Arduino boards, its big number of ports, and the very user friendly RoboPlus software.
